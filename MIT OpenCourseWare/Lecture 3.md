Definitions:  
Negligible Function: A function $f(k)$ is negligible if $\forall p(k)$, $\exists k_0$, $\forall k > k_0$, $f(k) < \frac{1}{p(k)}$  
OWF: $f:$ { $0,1$ } $^{\*}$ -> { $0,1$ } $^{\*}$, $\forall PPT A$, $P(A(f(x) = x^{'}|f(x^{'}) = f(x)) < \frac{1}{p(k)}$  
WOWF: $f:$ { $0,1$ } $^{\*}$ -> { $0,1$ } $^{\*}$, $\forall PPT A$, $P(A(f(x) = x^{'}|f(x^{'}) = f(x)) < 1 - \frac{1}{Q(k)}$  
There will never be OWFs, only candidate OWFs.

Groups Properties:  
Closure: $Z_N$ is a set of numbers, where a certain operation is applied to 2 random numbers in the group, the output falls in the group  

Identity: The number when the operation of the group is applied to all numbers, all outputs are the same as the input (Identity element) (Multiplicative Groups \= 1\) (Additive Groups \= 0\)  

Inverses: The number in the group has an inverse that, when the group’s operation is applied to both numbers, the answer is 0\. (Inverse element)  

Associative: It does not matter how the numbers in the groups are grouped in an equation, as long as the sequence remains unchanged.  
($A \oplus B$) $\oplus C = A \oplus$ ($B \oplus C$) (Associative)  

Commutative: The Order in which the input is sequenced does not matter as long as the inputs are the same. (E.g. 1 + 2 = 2 + 1)  

$G$($Z_N$, $Operation$), where $Order(G) = |G|$, where $|G| =$ Number of elements in $Z_N$  

Legendre's Theorem:  
All outputs are within the group (Basically mod N)  
$\forall a \in Z_N$ ,$a^{|G|} = e$ (e \= Multiplicative inverse)  
$\forall a \in Z_N$, $a^{|G|} = e$ (e \= Addition inverse)  

Order(a):  
$Order(a)$ = $min\{i > 0|a^i = e\}$ (e \= Multiplicative Inverse)  
If $Order(a) = |G|$, a is a generator  
Or  
Euler’s Totient Function $\phi()$  

Generator:  
$a \in G$, $\{a\} = \{a^1$, $a^2,\dots,a^{|G|}\}|\{a^1$, $a^2,\dots,a^{|G|}\} = Z_N$ (Multiplicative Groups)  
$a \in G$, $\{a\} = \{a$, $2a$, $3a,\dots,a^{|G|}\}|\{a$, $2a$, $3a,\dots,a^{|G|}\} = Z_N$ (Additive Groups)  
A generator is a number when raised to an increasing integer (For multiplicative groups) or added it itself (For additive groups), returns every element within the set.  
{Primitive Roots}={Generators} Primitive Roots exist if the modulo is, 1, 2, 4, $p^k$, $2p^k$  
$2p^k$ is for odd primes p  
A group is cyclic if it has a generator  

**DLOG**  
$DLOG_g(a) = t$, $1 \leq t \leq |G|$, s.t $a = g^t$  
$DLOG_g(a) = t$, $1 \leq t \leq |G|$, s.t $a = g \cdot t$
Basically, an algorithm that solves the discrete log

Discrete Logarithm Problem (Informally)
Given G, $g = a$, $a \in G$. Find $DLOG_g(a)$
Given ($Z_p$, $+$), where p is prime, find $DLOG_g(a)$  
$g^t = a \pmod{p}$

Easy Problems:  
Can be solved in linear, quadratic, and cubic  
$a + b \pmod{n}$
$a \cdot b \pmod{n}$
$GCD(a$, $b)$
$a^{-1} \pmod{p}$ only when $GCD(a$, $p) = 1$ (Use Euclid's Extended Algorithm) $a \cdot x + p \cdot y = GCD(a$, $p) = 1$, find x, $x = a^{-1}$  
$a^b \pmod{n}$

**Multiplicative Modular Math**
$G = (Z_{N}^{*} = \{1 \leq z < N|GCD(z, n) = 1\}, \times)$
$|Z_{N}^{*}| = \phi(n)$, $|Z_{8}^{*}| = 4$, $|Z_{7}^{*}| = 6$
$|Z_{p}^{*}| = p - 1$, for p prime
$\phi(p \cdot q) = (p - 1)(q - 1)$ where p and q are coprime  
$|Z_{p_k}^{*}| = p^{(k - 1)}(p - 1)$, for p prime (General Formula)  
$\phi(p^k \cdot q^l) = \phi(p^k) \cdot \phi(q^l) = p^{(k-1)}(p-1) \cdot q^{(l-1)}(q-1)$ where p and q are coprime

Cyclic:  
$Z_p^{*}$, $Order(a)|(p - 1)$, $a^d = 1 \pmod{p}$  
Let's say there is a set for all exponents d where $a^d = 1 \pmod{p}$
If there is 1 value, a in the set, there are many values in the set where the set is
$d_1 = \{1$, $a$, $a^2$, $a^3,\dots,a^{d-1}\}$

Discrete Logarithm Problem (Formally)
$G(Z_p^{*}$, $\times)$
A prime, p  
A generator, $g \in G$  
An element $h \in G$
Find $x$ s.t
$g^x \equiv h \pmod{p}$

**Prime Number Theorem**
$n = \{1$, $2,\dots,n\}$
$\frac{\#Number of n bit primes}{\#Number of n bit numbers} \approx \frac{1}{nln(2)}$

Primality Testing \[Agrawal-Kayal-Saxena (AKS) Algorithm\]
Best for testing primes

How to test if a number is a generator
$\phi(n) = p - 1 = \prod q_1^{k_n}$
$g^{\frac{\phi(n)}{q_i}} \pmod{n}$
In simple terms, separate the totient of p into its prime factors, then check using the algorithm below, if none of the answer are 1, g is a generator

**Strong Primes**
$p = \vartheta q + 1$, where q is prime,  is an integer
or  
$p - 1 = \vartheta q$
In simple terms, this ensures that $p - 1$ is not a number that only consists of small factors, making it easy to find the $\phi(p)$. This helps to keep p is a safe prime, not vulnerable to totient formula attacks

**Discrete Algorithm Problems**
$F = \{F_{n^{'}}$ $D_{n^{'}}\}_{n \in N}$
$F_n = \{f:D_n$->$R_n\}$ (A function that gives the corresponding output from the input)

The goal
→ Sample a $f_y \in F_N$ in $poly(n)$ time (Finding an OWF)  
→ Sample an element in $D_n$ in $poly(n)$ time (Finding an element)  
→ $f_y$ in $poly(n)$ (Computing the function)  
$EXP_{p,g}(x) = g^x \pmod{p}$, where p is an n-bit prime, g is a generator of Zp\*  
$D_n = \{0,1,2,\dots,p-2\}$ (Domain of D, or valid inputs of D)  
$Z_{p}^{*} = R_n$ (Outputs of all valid inputs)  
$len(D_n) = len(R_n)$ (There is a unique output for every valid input)

In simple terms, there are a family of problems known as $F_n$, where there are $D_n$ inputs and $R_n$ outputs, and an example of one of the members of this family is $DLOG()$

Solving for x:
$a = g^x = g^{x_1 \cdot m + x_2}$, $m \approx \sqrt{p}$
$a \cdot g^{-x_2} = (g^{m})^{x_1}$

Algorithm to find $\sqrt{p}$ in polynomial time/Solve DLP:  
Compute all values of $g^{-x_2}$ for $x_2 \in \{0,1,2,3,4,5,\dots,m-1\}$
Make a table for all values of $x_2$
$\{a \cdot g^{-x_2}\} = \{\forall x_2\}$ (Length is p)
$\{(g^m)^{x_1}\} = \{\forall x_1\}$ (Length is p)
Sort the tables and go through each of them until
$a \cdot g^{-x_2} = (g^m)^{x_1}$
$x = x_1 + x_2$
Time taken: $\sqrt{p}$  
Also known as the Meet-in-the-Middle Approach or [Baby-Step Giant-Step](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bGRV8OVXUC0II34-JJmrioFjNp7eEorl?usp=sharing)

Index Calculus Method:  
Time take: $2^{O(\sqrt{(log(N)log(log(N))})}$
Step 1:
Choose a set of small primes (E.g. {2,3,5,7})

Step 2  
Calculate a table of $g^x \equiv p \pmod{N}$, where p can be completely factored by the set of small primes.

Step 3  
Build a system of equations:
Where p is factorable by our set of small primes  
$g^{x_1} \equiv p_1$ => $x_1 = log_g(p_1)$
$g^{x_2} \equiv p_2$ => $x_2 = log_g(p_2)$
If $g^{x_3} \equiv p_3$ and $p_3 = p_a \cdot p_b$
$x_3 = log_g(p_a) + log_g(p_b)$

Step 4
$x = a \cdot log_g(p_1) + b \cdot log_g(p_2)$
Where a and b are the exponents of the primes used to express p  
Example:
Find x s.t  $5^x \equiv 8 \pmod{37}$
$5^{11} \equiv 2$ => $11 = log_5(2)$
$5^{22} \equiv 3$ => $22 = log_5(3)$
$5^{k} \equiv 8$ => $k = 2log_5(2) + log_5(3)$ as $8 = 2^2 \cdot 3$
$x = k = 2log_5(2) + log_5(3)$

Solving the systems (ICM):
Have 2 sets of equations with the same results that have the same prime base  
Use simultaneous equations and inverses to calculate the direct $DLOG()$ of a prime base
This can give you $log_g(p)$, $p\{2,3,5,7\dots\}$, p is in the set of small primes.
